     - `microsoft/vscode`
     - `https://github.com/facebook/react`
     - `tensorflow/tensorflow`

2. **Optional: Add GitHub Token**
   - For higher rate limits (5000 requests/hour vs 60)
   - Required for private repositories
   - Create a token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens

## GitHub API Rate Limits

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The GitHub API has strict rate limits that you need to be aware of:

- **Without Token**: 60 requests per hour (very limited)
- **With Token**: 5,000 requests per hour (recommended)
- **Large Repositories**: Will definitely require a token to fetch all data

### Getting a GitHub Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token" ‚Üí "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name (e.g., "PR Dashboard")
4. Select expiration (30 days recommended for testing)
5. **No scopes needed** for public repositories (leave all checkboxes unchecked)
6. Click "Generate token"
7. Copy the token and paste it in the sidebar of the app

**Note**: The token is only stored in your browser session and is not saved anywhere.

## Example Repositories to Try

- `microsoft/vscode` - Popular code editor
- `facebook/react` - React JavaScript library
- `tensorflow/tensorflow` - Machine learning framework
- `kubernetes/kubernetes` - Container orchestration
- `nodejs/node` - Node.js runtime
- `python/cpython` - Python programming language

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Rate Limit Exceeded**
   - Add a GitHub personal access token
   - Wait for the rate limit to reset (1 hour)

2. **Repository Not Found**
   - Check the repository name spelling
   - Ensure the repository is public (or provide a token for private repos)

3. **No Data Displayed**
   - Repository might not have any pull requests
   - Check if the repository exists and is accessible

4. **Slow Loading**
   - Large repositories may take time to fetch all data
   - The app limits to 1000 PRs to prevent excessive API calls

### Error Messages

- **403 Forbidden**: Rate limit exceeded or private repository without token
- **404 Not Found**: Repository doesn't exist or is private
- **422 Unprocessable Entity**: Invalid repository format

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Streamlit web framework
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for data manipulation
- **Visualizations**: Plotly for interactive charts
- **API Integration**: GitHub REST API v3

### Performance Considerations
- **Simple & Efficient**: Always fetches only the last 100 PRs (most recent) from any repository
- **Single API Call**: Uses only 1 API request per repository analysis
- **Rate Limit Friendly**: Minimizes API usage to work reliably even without tokens
- Data is cached in session state for filtering operations
- Fast loading and responsive interface

### Security
- GitHub tokens are handled securely (password input type)
- No data is stored permanently on the server
- All API calls use HTTPS
